                                            consciousness which is the vehicle of the western description of India and
                                            using these descriptions an attempt is being made to offer a partial
                                            description of western culture. This partial description is then used to
                                            contrast the differences in the way Indians go about their world and that
                                            becomes the beginning of offering alternative descriptions of India.

                                        <p>The focus of the project is to analyze the narratives that exist on Bhakti
                                            traditions. These narratives tell us that Bhakti is a social reform
                                            movement, that is, its aim was to fight against caste system, untouchability
                                            and so on. However, if we look at the compositions and stories
                                            (Hagiographies) of Bhakti saints, it is cognitively difficult to illustrate
                                            the idea that Bhakti tradition is a movement of any sort. Therefore, what is
                                            Bhakti about? What is the connection of Hagiographies with that of the
                                            historical idea of Bhakti as a movement? What ideas have shaped today's
                                            academic literature about Bhakti? etc. are the questions of enquiry which
                                            this project is engaging with. This is also an attempt to establish the
                                            continuity of various Bhakti traditions within the larger aadhyatmic
                                            framework within which these compositions explicitly locate themselves.

                                        <p>In contemporary comparative politics, there is a difficulty to make sense of
                                            how politics happens in the non-western cultures against the western
                                            politics which relies on political theory. There is also an inability to
                                            make comparisons between politics in western and non-western cultures. This
                                            project seeks to understand the kinds of hurdles that stand in theorizing
                                            comparative politics and clearing the ground to think about an alternative
                                            model of politics. This project will focus on Arthashatra and the subsequent

                                        <p>With over a century of sociological exploration of Indian villages, there
                                            exists a body of literature which continues to offer some image or the other
                                            of Indian villages. These studies carry a series of images of Indian society
                                            which were part of European experience of India. The peculiarity of these
                                            descriptions rests in the association between Hindu religion, caste system
                                            and Indian villages. Village studies develop a series of inferences
                                            sociologically based on an aforementioned cluster of ideas. Today, on the
                                            one hand there are sociological descriptions of Indian villages which have
                                            become common sense as some kind of scientific truths and on the other hand
                                            these descriptions seem to be full of anomalies, and they do not adequately
                                            capture the sociological dynamics of Indian villages. This study would
                                            therefore focus on building a critique of village studies in Sociology and
                                            developing alternative framework to understand villages by investing
                                            intellectual energy on developing village mapping tools. Eventually, if
                                            possible, the study intends to conceptualize a decision support system to
                                            intervene in the development of villages.

                                        <p>Historical sociology of Education is perplexing and appears to suggest a
                                            monolithic stereotype about Indians and their learning habits. A critical
                                            examination of this discourse of education would hint that a large part of
                                            our claims on learning and pedagogy at least in school education has its
                                            origin in the colonial period and it is based on assumptions which have no
                                            theoretical or empirical basis. One classical example is demonstrated by the
                                            alleged problems on rote learning and its policy and pedagogic implications.
                                            This study points out that the problems with memorization and repetition in
                                            Indian learning can’t be demonstrated as an empirical or theoretical claim
                                            but rather it shows the problems of Protestant contempt for certain learning
                                            processes in Christian traditions in Europe, and it has become the
                                            scientific truth of Indian students. This study further investigates the
                                            education in colonial India including Dharampal’s work. The ideas of
                                            Pedagogy and learning will be reconstructed by examining the historical
                                            sociological material on India in this project.

                                        <p>There is a consensus among scholars that Indian texts possess knowledge about
                                            Indian culture. The descriptions about India that come from different
                                            domains like Indology, Anthropology, Sociology, Political Science, etc., are
                                            claimed to be based on Indian texts. They also take certain positions about
                                            how these texts have played an important role in shaping Indian society
                                            today. These claims are the consequences of the methodological approach to
                                            understanding Indian texts. In this study, an attempt will be made to show
                                            how diverse approaches to study texts have been drawn from various
                                            Philological and Hermeneutical understanding of European experience have

                                            traditions. An attempt will be made to show how many of these methods which
                                            are used to study Indian texts are deriving assumptions about the dynamics
                                            of European society as though it is the universal story of the entire

                                        <p>The debate on indigenous governance in India, particularly in the context of
                                            Panchayats, has been central to discussions on institutional structures and
                                            governance models. While some view institutions through a state-led lens,
                                            often overlooking indigenous models, others have advocated for their
                                            reclamation since the early 20th century. The 73rd Amendment to the Indian
                                            Constitution was a significant step towards integrating indigenous
                                            governance into modern state structures. However, Dharampal challenges the
                                            notion of Panchayats as indigenous institutions, arguing that they were a
                                            British creation. His data suggests that both proponents and opponents of
                                            Panchayats are inadvertently following European descriptions. A historical
                                            analysis of these debates can shed light on two crucial questions: What was
                                            the alternative model of governance that Indians had, and what kind of
                                            political organization was necessary to support indigenous governance? This
                                            project aims to reconstruct this indigenous model of governance.

                                        <p>Language serves as a vital tool for communication, enabling interaction
                                            within and across communities, and plays a key role in socialization and
                                            international relations. India is multilingual with individuals often
                                            speaking multiple languages belonging to diverse linguistic communities,
                                            coexisting and interacting in shared spaces. India is also known since
                                            centuries for its linguistically rich social life and a deep cultural
                                            engagement with linguistic practices such as grammar, poetry, and
                                            literature. However, in recent times, language has become central to
                                            political debates, influencing state formation and identity politics.
                                            Conflicts such as the Cauvery water dispute and the Karnataka-Maharashtra
                                            border issue have evolved into linguistic identity struggles between
                                            Kannada, Tamil, and Marathi speakers. These developments raise critical
                                            questions about how language-related conflicts should be understood in
                                            post-independence India. This research suggests that these tensions emerge
                                            from viewing language through a European notion of the ‘nation’ in
                                            association with ideas such as religion, ethnicity and language. This
                                            project further aims to revisit and explain the role of

                                            language in relation to governance in pre-colonial India by examining its
                                            function in state structures before the arrival of colonial rule, drawing
                                            from available resources including inscriptions and other scholarly
                                            engagements in the field.

                                        <p>In India and abroad, attempts to write accurate history of India is an
                                            emerging trend. The proponents who speak for writing an accurate history
                                            claim that the existing history of India is distorted. However, it is
                                            unclear what brings about ‘accuracy’ to the accurate history which many want
                                            to write about. Such attempts are mostly undertaken by postcolonial
                                            historians to demonstrate that Indians also have sense of ‘accurate’ history
                                            which Orientals scholars’ thought was absent in India. However, does writing
                                            another ‘accurate history’ enable us to understand India’s past? Answering
                                            this question requires us to contrast ‘the past’ with ‘a history’ and

                                            reflect about its past. This project will re-examine texts like Rajavali
                                            Kathasara in Kannada and Rajabali in Bengali. It will then try to identify
                                            the difference between history writing and the way Indians saw their past.
                                            It will also discuss questions of when and how did Indians learn to talk
                                            about and write history.

                                        <p>The concept of world literature, while seemingly appealing to the ideals of
                                            humanism, has become entangled in discussions of cultural asymmetries and
                                            power relations in recent decades. The dominant paradigm, often centered
                                            around the metropolis and the periphery, has resulted in a focus on
                                            "worlding" the periphery, often through translation into English. The idea
                                            of ‘worlding’ itself is the beginning point of power asymmetries. This
                                            raises questions about the role of translation, power dynamics, and the
                                            representation of diverse literatures. To explore an alternative
                                            perspective, this project proposes to examine Sanskrit poetics and its
                                            understanding of the purpose of Kavya. By doing so, we aim to contribute to
                                            a more nuanced and equitable discourse in world literature, one that
                                            challenges the prevailing power dynamics and offers a new framework for
                                            understanding and appreciating diverse literary traditions.
