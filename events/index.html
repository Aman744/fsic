                                            Mudabidri, June 2016. The conference focused on understanding a) the
                                            significance of Vivekananda’s intuitions for social sciences and the study
                                            of Indian culture in the 21st century and b) his distortion of the western
                                            Christian concepts and what this tells us about Indian culture and its
                                            traditions. Some of the specific themes that this conference intends to take
                                            up for discussion are Vivekananda’s views on nationalism, politics, Hinduism
                                            and Christianity, social reform, education and cultural differences.

                                        <p>Maatukathe is a series of courses on philosophy of science organized by
                                            Aarohi Research Foundation.<br><br>
                                            The first course of the series, focused on understanding the notion of
                                            “Science” and elaborate discussions were led by Prof. Narahari Rao. The
                                            discussions drew the attention of the participants in at least two different
                                            ways by which “science” is understood. First, when we counter-pose doing
                                            things haphazardly to a way of doing it scientifically, we mean science to
                                            be doing things in a methodical manner. Second, we also use the word to
                                            refer to some well-established academic disciplines like physics or biology.
                                            The second course of the series focused on engagement with theory making in
                                            terms of narration building.

                                            Texts," at the Ritambara Retreat in Bengaluru on May 6 and 7, 2023. The
                                            workshop was designed to examine the complexities of translating between
                                            Indian and European languages, with a particular focus on the relationship
                                            between language, knowledge, and experience. Discussions delved into the
                                            historical context of the British education system's impact on native
                                            languages in India and explored the inherent challenges of translating texts
                                            that carry significant cultural differences. The central idea was to arm
                                            participants with a deeper understanding of these issues so they could, in
                                            turn, help sensitize others.
